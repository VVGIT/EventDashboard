Dashboard using Highcharts, NodeJS, Express

Steps to execute the source code and view the dashboards:

After saving the source code files in a directory on your local disk, use the Command Prompt to change focus into the directory you have saved the files in.

Use "gulp serve" command so that gulp can automatically install all of the required library dependencies. This command will also start a web server and begin listening to the port 3000.

In a different command prompt window, from the project directory, open the /public/Python directory and issue the command: getData.py

Open a web browser and type the URL: "localhost:3000/index.html". You should see the dashboard.
